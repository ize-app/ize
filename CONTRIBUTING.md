# Contributing

We welcome contributions. I'm not actively developing Ize, but feel free to make PRs and issues. I'll do my best to respond. Please keep your PRs focused, small, easy to review, and with appropriate testing. If you're interested in becoming a core maintainer of Ize, ping me at ize.inquiries@gmail.com
