        <p>
          <strong>TL;DR</strong> Ize is a platform for collaborative, cross-tool, evolutionary
          workflows. These workflows define how collaborators get shit done via collaborative
          workflows that span across tools, organizational boundaries, and online identities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Everything</i> in Ize happens via workflows, including the process to evolve workflows
          as needs change. Our goal is to establish an open standard and plug-in ecosystem for
          defining collaborative workflows across various tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ize unlocks new possibilities for organizational power dynamics and collective
          intelligence. If this vision excites you, email us at{" "}

          The human brain isn&#39;t cut out for the accelerating fragmentation, information
          overload, and change of modern life. This is especially true for modern online work. While
          early humans could once count on a stable set of collaborators, tools, and information,
          online collaboration is exponentially more complex.{" "}
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Online work is fragmented across time, teams, tools.
            Seemingly simple tasks are complex puzzle of aligning schedules, tool permissions, and
            identifying key stakeholders.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Noise:</strong> Online work is a torrent of irrelevant notifications. We
            struggle to pick out what deserves our attention or get the attention of others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Futility:</strong> Online work is disempowering and disconnected. We don&#39;t
            know how to make our voices heard or how to evolve processes that inevitably go stale
            and brittle in the accelerating change of the modern world.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If software created the crisis of modern work, could it somehow be used to fix it? Our
          current set of online tools only seem to make the problem worse. Each new tool is yet
          another demand on our our attentional reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          A solution would need to reduce our attentional overhead while enabling new modes of
          collaboration. It must be able to bridge otherwise disparate online identities, groups,
          and tools into something unified and coherent. It must be able to not only simply handle
          complexity, but also be able to adapt to quickly changing circumstances.
        </p>
        <h2 id="introducing-ize-üëÄ">Introducing Ize üëÄ</h2>
        <p>
          Ize is the first platform for building and evolving collaborative workflows. A{" "}
          <strong>collaborative workflow</strong> defines how a group of people harness their
          collective attention to do a particular task. For example, you might define workflows to
          add a calendar invite to a shared calendar, run a sprint retro, publish a blog post,
          approve an expense, change someone&#39;s Discord permissions, prioritize on team
          objectives, etc.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Workflows are a language for defining any set of arbitrary collaborative processes. This
          language defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Requests</em>: Who can trigger the workflow (e.g. a set of email addresses, Discord
            Roles, or NFTs)
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Response</em>: Who can respond and what response is being asked for - a vote, ranked
            priorities, a free text response, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Result</em>: How those responses come to a final output (e.g. a decision, an LLM
            summary, etc) and action (e.g. take an action in another platform, trigger a webhook,
            evolve a workflow).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By making it easy to explicitly define any collaborative online process, Ize introduces
          radical new possibilities for how power can flow and how collective intelligence can be
          harnessed. Teams can take action without being blocked by bottlenecks. Leaders can regain
          sanity with transparent, auditable process. Contibutors can quickly find discover ways to
          take action and make their voice heard. Organizers can craft coalitions across inter/intra
          organizational boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the accelerating pace of change of modern life, any collaborative process needs to be
          able to quickly adapt. Ize workflows are built for change. The process to evolve a
          workflow is, itself, a collaborative workflow. In fact, everything in Ize is a workflow.
          There is no concept of an &quot;admin&quot; in Ize. It&#39;s workflows{" "}
          <em>all the way down</em> üê¢.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the fundamental unit of Ize is the &quot;workflow&quot; rather than an
          &quot;organization&quot;, Ize is structured closer to a mycelial network than a tradtional
          SaaS dominator heirarchy. Ize workflows can combine otherwise online identities and groups
          into a coherent process. For example, an &quot;Approve expense&quot; workflow could be
          triggered by a Discord server&#39;s @contributor role, approved by holders of a particular
          Hats NFT, and evolved by a set of email addresseses.
        </p>
        <p>
          This mycelial network extends to how Ize evolves itself over the time. The vision is for
          Ize to become an open standard and plugin ecosystem for defining collaborative process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ize is a pardigm shift in collaborative tooling. It is cross-tool, distributed,
          asynchronous, and evolutionary. Though it is a new category of tool, it draws inspiration
          from its predecessors. It&#39;s like a DAO tool (Snapshot, DAOHaus), but with
          task-specific, highly-flexible, evolutionary subDAOs. It&#39;s like an automation tool
          (Zapier, Pipedream), but for collaborative workflows rather than purely automated
          workflows. It like a decision/brainstorming tool (Loomio, Retrium), but cross-platform and
          with automatic execution of actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ize is ultimately about how we pool our collective attention to get shit done. Pooling our
          collective attention in the modern era requires bridging different online tools, groups,
          and identities into coherent workflows. The purpose of Ize is to offload this cognitive
          load to software, so that collaboration can once again feel connected, purposeful, and
          nourishing.
